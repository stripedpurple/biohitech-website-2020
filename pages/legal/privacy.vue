              <h3 class="title is-size-5">Statement</h3>
              <p>This Privacy Statement is updated as of May 25, 2018 . We reserve the right to update this Privacy
                Statement. If We update this Privacy Statement, We will use reasonable electronic efforts to advise you
                of the change, which may include posting a notice of the change in the Service, or we may send you an
                electronic notification of the change. If We electronically notify you by an electronic communication,
                We will provide these electronic messages to your last known or provided electronic communication
                address (which may be for example, a text message address, Twitter user name, Facebook address or other
                site address). You are responsible to review communications we send to those addresses, to authorize
                communications from us, and to keep those addresses up to date. Use of the Service after our notice of a
                change in the Privacy Statement is acceptance of the terms and changes in the updated Privacy Statement,
                which shall, unless expressly prohibited by applicable law (or unless expressly stated in such changed
                Privacy Statement), be effective from the inception of your use of the Service.</p>

              <h2 class="title is-size-4">Information about You</h2>
              <p>We, business partners, and service providers, use the Information about You to support your use of the
                Service. Information about You includes direct identifiers-such as your name, user name or number, and
                contact information-and other information associated with the direct identifiers-such as account
                information. If We remove direct identifiers about you, such information is no longer considered
                Information about You and is not subject to this Privacy Statement. Information about You is collected
                through a variety of sources, including directly from you, through your interaction with the Service,
                and from the other persons who may provide Information about You through the Service. Many functions of
                the Service involve you directly submitting information (such as by subscribing to one of our services)
                so you may benefit from features or participate in activities using the Service. For example, We collect
                or derive Information about You through the Service when you respond to questions and images to derive
                your personality profile.</p>

            <div class="column is-full">
              <h2 class="title is-size-4">Uses of Information About You</h2>
              <p>We, along with our affiliates, business partners, and service providers, use the information about you
                to
                provide or promote our products and services, to fulfill your information requests, and contact you as
                you have requested. Except as otherwise stated, we may also use information about you to improve our
                programs or the content of our Service, and for our analysis. In cases where We remove the elements of
                your information that could identify you, We may use and disclose the resulting “de-identified”
                information without restrictions. For example, We may create de-identified, statistical, and aggregate
                data results for research purposes and for reporting to other organizations. This data reported will not
                contain personal identifiers and will not identify individuals.</p>

                  transfer the Information about You, in which case any such buyer or acquiring party would be subject

                <li>To respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or

                <li>We may also provide Information about You and your use of the Service to others or for other
                  purposes if you authorize Us to do so. For example, We may offer specific functions associated to

                  authorize an information disclosure.
