                  TCP/IP

                  transmitted
                  via the Internet Service should correctly identify the sender and source; You may not alter the
                  attribution

            <p>The above list of acceptable and unacceptable uses of the Service is not intended to be
              exhaustive, but rather illustrative of the range of unacceptable uses. We have the right in Our sole discretion
              to determine whether any particular conduct is an acceptable use of the Service. In cases where We determine You
              engaged in conduct that You reasonably believed did not violate this policy in good faith, We will attempt to
              provide You electronic notice of Our determination that such conduct is not an acceptable use, but in an
              emergency as determined by Us, We may immediately terminate such access and make attempts at post termination
              notice.</p>
