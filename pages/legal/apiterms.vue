              services (the “BioHiTech API”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
              or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such company or other
              entity to this Agreement. If this Agreement is made part of another written agreement such as an
              order for services, whether or not made via electronic means (the “Order Agreement”), the terms
              and conditions of this Agreement are supplementary to such other agreement, and if there is an
              actual conflict between them, the terms and conditions of the other written agreement control
              over this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, this Agreement shall control over any Terms of
              Service/Terms of Use available on the BioHiTech website and BioHiTech Cloud website.</p>
            <p>By building, distributing, making available or otherwise providing applications or services that

                  related to a User solely available to that User, or if your service provides for group
                  sharing, available to other Users who have been authorized by such User to view their
                  BioHiTech Data and Content;

                  BioHiTech Marks may not be displayed on or near third party content or services where such
                  display may indicate that BioHiTech is associated with, endorses or approves of such third

                  such event.
                </li>
                <li>If BioHiTech provides technology in the BioHiTech API to allow single sign on (i.e. such
                  that a User that authenticates on your service will also be automatically authenticated on
                  the BioHiTech Service) you should make that single sign on technology available to your
                  Users who want to access BioHiTech Services (which can be in addition to other access
                  methods).
                </li>
                <li>You must not engage in any act that prevents BioHiTech from logging the access or use of the
                  BioHiTech API, or otherwise circumvent the proper functioning of the BioHiTech API.
                </li>
                <li>You will not use the BioHiTech API or any other information from BioHiTech to replicate or

                <li>Display of, and access to, User information supplied to you through the BioHiTech API must
                  only be used and displayed in accordance with your privacy policy which shall be in

                  BioHiTech Service, without the express written permission of BioHiTech. You may not
                  circumvent any access or copy controls placed on any BioHiTech Data and Content or the
                  BioHiTech API or BioHiTech Service. You will immediately report any actual or suspected

                  All such security information is confidential information of BioHiTech under this Agreement

            <p>Survival. Except as provided in an Order Agreement, this Agreement shall commence on the date you
              first download or otherwise acquire the BioHiTech API and will remain in effect until terminated
              by either party by written notice. BioHiTech may terminate this Agreement immediately if
              BioHiTech reasonably determines in its subjective good faith that you or any of your Users have
              or are likely to violate any provision of this Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement
              shall also terminate the licenses granted hereunder. Upon termination of this Agreement for any
              reason, you will stop using, and either return to BioHiTech, or at BioHiTech’s election destroy
              and remove from all computers, hard drives, networks, and other storage media, all copies of the
              Licensed Materials and any Confidential Information in your possession, and shall certify to
              BioHiTech that such actions have occurred. All provisions of this Agreement survive its
              termination except Sections 2.a and 2.b, provided that to the extent a User has downloaded or
              otherwise maintained a copy of the BioHiTech Data and Content, such User shall have a continuing
              license to use such BioHiTech Data and Content for that User’s own personal purposes.</p>

              exemplary, punitive, compensatory, or consequential damages (including loss of use, data,

          <div class="column is-full">
            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Miscellaneous.</h2>
            <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with
              respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and merges all prior proposals,
              understandings, and contemporaneous communications, whether oral, written or electronic. If any
              provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be
              limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise
              remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any modification of or changes to this
              Agreement must be in a writing duly authorized by an authorized representative of BioHiTech or
              pursuant to the provisions herein. You may not assign any of the rights or obligations granted
              under this Agreement, voluntarily or by operation of law (including without limitation in
              connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) except with the express written
              consent of BioHiTech, and any attempted assignment in violation of this paragraph is void.
              BioHiTech may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without
              notice or consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created
              as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other
              in any respect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
              the State of Delaware, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America.
              You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
              shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in
              Delaware. The section and paragraph headings in this Agreement, along with all provided
              annotations, are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
              The failure of BioHiTech to enforce any part of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
              its right to later enforce that or any other part of this Agreement. Waiver of compliance in any
              particular instance does not mean that BioHiTech will waive compliance in the future. In order
              for any waiver of any covenant or right under this Agreement to be binding, such waiver must be
              memorialized in a writing duly authorized by BioHiTech. Unless otherwise specified, all notices
              under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when
              received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
              requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or
              the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery
              service. All notices to BioHiTech shall be sent to support@biohitech.com. All notices to you
              shall be sent to the location or email address specified in your BioHiTech API or BioHiTech Data
              and Content access registration information.</p>
