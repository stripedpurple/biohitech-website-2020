              third parties; such marks are owned by third parties and unless expressly stated, We are not affiliated with or

              Information posted on the Service; nor do We review or warrant the quality or accuracy of Information that You
              may acquire from the Service. You agree not to sue or make any claim of any kind against Us regarding
              Information posted or available on the Service. When We become aware of any incorrect Information, harmful
              activities or if We receive any claim from a third party, in Our sole and unfettered discretion We may take

              party) or any other action We deem appropriate. We may be required to remove or block access to content or
              postings upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, and We may do so by disabling an entire page

              claim against Us shall be for Us to repair, replace or remove erroneous or illegal Information.</p>

            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Disclaimers as to Information; Limitations of Liability.</h2>

            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Linking; No Framing.</h2>
            <p>We permit reasonable, good faith and non-defamatory links to the Service so long as:
              (i) it is clear in the link reference that We have not endorsed the contents of the referring page, and that any

            <p>You may not directly access Our database except (1) via the standard /browser/graphic
              user interface; or (2) via Our application program interface (API), after agreeing to Our API license agreement
              (and then, only when You access in compliance with the terms of said API license). You may not use (and We do
              not consent to) any robot, script, or other automated tool to access or use the Service, any Information, or any
              data or the database. You may not manually access or copy the database, Information or Service or any part of
              thereof, except solely and exclusively in accordance with Your license granted above. The above shall not
              prohibit any act permitted by law, as by, for example, a bona fide search engine that is automatically indexing
              the Service for its search engine database (as long as the result of a query to such search engine returns a
              link back to the Service), and the search engine is not re-presenting the Information in a manner that is or
              would be competitive to the Service, or using the Information to present in a search query response to a user,
              links to competing websites.</p>

            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Copyright Complaints.</h2>

              notification of alleged copyright infringement, We promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing
              material as described herein in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and We may terminate the
              accounts of persons engaging in such acts, or take other means, including IP blocking, to disable such access.
              If You believe that any material on the Service infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, You may
              send a written notification of such infringement to Our Designated Agent at support@biohitech.com and to
              BioHiTech America, .</p>

            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Termination.</h2>
            <p>Unless a Service Order provides otherwise We may terminate Your access to the Service
              for any reason, or no reason, at any time in Our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>

            <p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted herein. Except as set forth in these Terms
              of Use, no express or implied license or right of any kind is granted to You regarding the Service. Except as
              expressly permitted herein, You covenant not to know, use, produce, receive, reproduce, copy, market, sell,
              distribute, transfer, translate, modify, adapt, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Service or any
              software comprised in the Service, or to create derivative works based on, or obtain possession of any source
              code of, or technological material relating to, the Service or any portion thereof.</p>

              and submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any action, suit, or other legal proceeding
              that may arise out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, by the state or federal courts of the State of
              Delaware.</p>

            <h2 class="title is-size-4">Arbitration.</h2>
            <p>Except for solely equitable claims which may be pursued immediately and directly in
              court, all claims by a party for breach of this Agreement that are not resolved by mutual written agreement
              shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration
              Association. The location of such arbitration shall be in the State that Our principal offices are located at
              the time the dispute arises, or at a location determined by the arbitrator(s). The parties shall mutually agree

              Arbitration Association. Arbitration may be commenced by either party by giving written notice to the other
              party that the dispute has been referred to arbitration under this Section. Any award rendered by the arbitrator
              shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties, provided that any such award shall be accompanied by a written
              opinion giving the reasons for the award. This Section shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the
              decision of the arbitrator may be filed under the Federal Arbitration Act or any equivalent state arbitration
              act as an award of arbitration and shall be a judgment of record in such court; provided however, that either
              party may appeal the decision of the arbitrator as if such decision had been rendered by such court sitting
              without a jury, subject to all court rules and procedures for collection and stay of judgment. Each party shall
              pay its own expenses of arbitration and the expenses of the arbitrator shall be equally shared. In all cases
              each of the parties IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY of any claim arising out of
              or related to this Agreement or the performance or non performance of either party.</p>
