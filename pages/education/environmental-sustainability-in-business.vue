            <h2 class="title">Environmental Sustainability in Business</h2>
            <p>An environmentally sustainable business is one that provides service and makes a profit
              without compromising the future of the environment. This means that exploiting resources, developing new
              products and technologies, and building infrastructure are all done without overtaxing or depleting the earth’s
              resources.</p>
            <p>With environmental problems like global warming and air, water, and soil pollution
              threatening the sustainability of the planet, it’s essential for business owners to join in the worldwide shift
              towards more eco-friendly ways of working. In Hong Kong, a study revealed that in 2013 air pollution alone
              caused productivity losses and medical bills worth HK$39.4 billion. That’s why some of the world’s largest
              companies are now disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and other vital energy metrics.</p>
            <p>Also, companies like BioHiTech Global are continually creating innovative products and
              services that can promote recycling, effective waste management, and waste-to-energy fuels that reduce landfill
              usage. To meet your company’s goals, you need to understand environmental stability.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Why Is Sustainability Important in Business?</h2>
            <p>Sustainability is now a part of key performance metrics in some organizations for the
              following reasons:</p>
            <div class="content">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>It reduces the cost of doing business:</strong>&nbsp;Puma, a sports gear manufacturer,
                  became the
                  first big company to make the cost of water and carbon public way back in 2011. The company was able
                  to use
                  the data to discover ways to reduce fuel, energy, and water consumption by 60 percent. This reduction
                  resulted in savings that ran into the millions of dollars across their supply chain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Renewable energy stabilizes energy costs:</strong>&nbsp;Using renewable energy sources helps
                  you
                  avoid the price volatility that’s a constant feature of fossil-based fuels. When using power from
                  renewable
                  sources like biofuels, solar, and wind, you can minimize the effect of the unpredictable cost of
                  energy.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consumers are concerned about it:</strong>&nbsp;Most customers today are aware of the
                  dangers of
                  climate change and global warming. So, they’ll adjust their spending habits and patronize companies
                  and
                  brands that show they’re environmentally sustainable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h2 class="title">Sustainability Ideas for Companies That Care About the Environment</h2>
            <p>Building an environmentally sustainable business requires making specific policies and
              taking a more disciplined and focused approach to all business decisions. Thankfully, the rewards far outweigh
              the costs involved. The following ideas can help you ensure sustainability in all your business operations:</p>
            <div class="content">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Have a plastic-free day:</strong>&nbsp;At least once a month, implement a zero-plastic
                  policy. Don’t
                  use anything plastic in your company, including tea or coffee cups and plastic bags.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use recycled stationery:</strong>&nbsp;While you should work towards a paperless office, you
                  may
                  still need paper. Ensure that you buy and use recycled paper packed in recycled materials.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Allow telecommuting:</strong>&nbsp;Encourage your staff to work from home at least once a
                  week. You
                  can also set up video conferencing for collaboration and meetings instead of allowing employees to
                  travel
                  over a long distance to attend meetings.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use smart devices:</strong>&nbsp;Use motion sensors to switch lights on or off in your
                  offices. You
                  can use a smart power strip to power off devices like phone chargers when the smartphone or tablet is
                  fully
                  charged.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Patronize green suppliers:</strong>&nbsp;Buy supplies that are produced by businesses that
                  adopt
                  sustainable manufacturing practices.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use renewable energy:</strong>&nbsp;Instead of fossil fuels, you can use renewable energy
                  sources.
                  If your business uses a lot of heat, consider using solid recovery fuel. Argo US, a cement
                  manufacturer,
                  uses our solid recovery fuel. You’ll be in good company.
                </li>
              </ul>
