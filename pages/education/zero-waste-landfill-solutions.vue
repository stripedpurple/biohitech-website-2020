            <p>Landfill diversion is becoming more critical to organizations worldwide as sustainability goals become a vital
              aspect of business and landfill space continues to reduce annually. In the U.S., the American Chemistry
              Council’s Plastic Division has already committed to recovering or recycling all the plastic packaging used in
              the U.S. by 2040.</p>
            <p>Customers and investors now expect clean and responsible manufacturing. This expectation has caused many
              companies to implement landfill diversions. Achieving a zero waste to landfill initiative leads to more
              efficient manufacturing processes that save both financial and physical resources by conserving energy and
              reusing raw materials.</p>
            <h2 class="title">What Is a Zero Waste Initiative?</h2>
            <p>U.S. municipalities and organizations have defined zero waste in diverse ways. Some focus on zero waste as a goal
              to achieve, while others call it a philosophy that guides their actions.</p>
            <p>Zero waste is an economical, ethical, efficient, and visionary goal that guides people to change their lifestyles
              and practices to follow sustainable natural cycles in which every discarded material (waste) is designed to be a
              resource for other people to use.</p>
            <p>Zero waste also means designing and coordinating processes to reduce and eliminate the amount of waste and toxic
              materials and conserve and recover resources without burying them in landfills. Implementing a zero-waste
              initiative means that there will be no discharges or emissions to the air, water, or land that are a known
              threat to human, animal or plant health.</p>
            <h2 class="title">What Is the Importance of Reducing Landfill Usage?</h2>
            <p>The most vital benefit is that we recover most or all of the raw materials used to make the products we rely on.
              Miners use a lot of energy to extract, refine, and transport fresh materials from the earth. This process of
              mineral and natural resource extraction can also lead to land degradation and social unrest in the communities
              where it takes place. Disposing of used products like plastics and organic waste into landfills increases land,
              air, and water pollution. That’s why it’s essential to recycle and reuse as much material as possible.</p>
            <p>Recycling enables us to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. It also helps us recover the energy used to make
              manufactured products. Without recycling, dumping these products into a landfill causes us to lose the energy
              used in producing them. Recycling food and other organic waste helps us reduce global warming by reducing the
              amount of methane gas released into the atmosphere.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Zero Landfill Waste Solutions</h2>
            <p>There are various ways to achieve a zero landfill goal. By adopting the three-pronged strategy of reducing,
              reusing, and recycling, it’s possible to keep waste away from the landfill consistently.</p>
            <p>Here are three suggestions to accomplish this:</p>
            <div class="content">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid plastic bottles:</strong>&nbsp;Don’t join the millions of people who throw plastic
                  bottles
                  away daily. Choose reusable glass bottles instead.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Recycle and buy recycled products:</strong>&nbsp;Choose products made from recycled
                  materials. This
                  way, you’re helping reduce landfills. Use recycled stationery at work and establish a policy that
                  rewards
                  workers for using environmentally friendly alternatives.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduce food waste:</strong>&nbsp;Avoid throwing food away by managing your portions and
                  cooking only
                  what your family can eat. Donate food that you buy and can’t eat. Then, ensure that you take care of
                  your
                  food waste. Instead of contributing to the millions of tons of food waste taken to landfills annually,
                  use
                  our food waste digester to convert it.
                </li>
              </ul>
