            <p>The EPA found that the United States generated nearly 41 million tons of food waste in 2017. Out of that food
              waste, we only diverted 6.3% from incinerators and landfills. Since larger industrial companies process a
              significant amount of food material, they have a major role to play in this diversion.</p>
            <p>At BioHiTech, we partner with Entsorga Italia to bring you High Efficiency Biological Treatment (HEBioT™)
              technology. This unique process separates organic and inorganic material to divert food waste from landfills.
              HEBioT™ makes it simple for your company to join the movement against food waste.</p>

            <h2 class="title">About HEBioT™</h2>
            <p>The Entsorga West Virginia plant in Martinsburg is the only facility in the United States currently deploying
              HEBioT™ technology. It provides the Eastern Panhandle with a proven, cost-effective way to divert traditional
              waste and reduce landfill usage.</p>
            <p>HEBioT™ utilizes automated sorting, biological composting and mechanical refinement to turn food waste into Solid
              Recovered Fuel (SRF). This technology can achieve as much as 80% landfill diversion through advanced and clean
              processes. Companies that work with large amounts of organic material can send their waste to our HEBioT™
              Renewable Resource Recovery Facility for eco-friendly treatment.</p>

            <h2 class="title">How Does HEBioT™ Perform Organic Waste Management?</h2>
            <p>HEBioT™ mechanically sorts food waste and inorganic material for biological processing as follows:</p>
            <div class="content">
              <ol>
                <li>Organic and inorganic waste move through a mechanical process that sorts each material for two types
                  of
                  processing.
                </li>
                <li>Any organic material, such as food waste, goes to a bio-oxidation hall. We process inorganic
                  material
                  differently depending on the material category.
                </li>
                <li>In the bio-oxidation hall, food waste and other organic material are biologically broken down and
                  dried into
                  SRF.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <h2 class="title">Methane-Free Food Waste Processing</h2>
            <p>The HEBioT™ process generates zero methane. Traditional organic waste management processes like landfill
              processing release methane that contributes to greenhouse gases. In addition, we filter the air in the
              bio-oxidation hall for methane-free treatment.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Turning Food Waste Into SRF</h2>
            <p>Food waste that undergoes the HEBioT™ process turns into EPA-recognized SRF, a confetti-like material. SRF has a
              similar BTU to coal, making it a viable alternative fuel source for multiple industries. Entsorga West Virginia
              partners with cement manufacturers who use SRF to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>By processing your food waste with HEBioT™, you’ll help us reduce the impact of carbon use on the environment.
              Combined with its landfill diversion capabilities, HEBioT™ can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as
              24,800 tons of carbon dioxide per year.</p>

            <h2 class="title">How Can My Company Use HEBioT™ in Our Food Waste Strategies?</h2>
            <p>Sending your organic waste to Entsorga West Virginia works in a similar way as bringing it to traditional waste
              processing facilities. We process waste in a single stream, sorting the materials for you. Bring your waste to
              the plant as you normally would, and we’ll handle the rest.</p>
            <p>Dropping off material at our HEBioT™ Renewable Resource Recovery Facility costs the same as traditional waste
              management services. For the same price as alternative options, you can divert your food waste from landfills.
