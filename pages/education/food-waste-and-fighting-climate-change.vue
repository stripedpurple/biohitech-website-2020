            <p>Food waste has a significant impact on global warming and climate change. A report by the Food and Agriculture
              Organization of the United Nations (FAO) states that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-bb144e.pdf"
                                                                           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-third of the food produced globally</a>&nbsp;reaches the
              landfill instead of the consumer’s table. This waste creates about eight percent of total global greenhouse
              emissions.</p>
            <p>By reducing food waste, we can help prevent climate change. The&nbsp;<a
              href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/reduced-food-waste" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">research organization</a>&nbsp;Project Drawdown discovered that reducing food
              waste can have the same effect on emissions as building wind turbines. Their study showed that if we take
              specific steps to reduce food waste, we can prevent more than 70 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions in the
              next 30 years.</p>
            <p>With BioHiTech digesters, your company can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions through smarter food waste
              management. Our digesters divert food waste from landfills on site and provide insightful data analytics through
              the BioHiTech Cloud.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Reducing Food Waste and Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
            <p>BioHiTech’s Revolution Series digesters provide a unique advantage in the industry — data insights. Each machine
              connects to the BioHiTech Cloud, a cloud data management platform that gives you real-time, accurate information
              on the digester’s usage. With these insights in mind, you can work to purchase less food, reducing both
              procurement costs and future food waste.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Divert Your Food Waste From Landfills</h2>
            <p>Every Revolution Series digester uses microorganisms, oxygen and warm water to break down food waste. This
              process turns the waste into a liquid that flows safely into your sewer line. By managing your food waste on
              site, you will divert it from landfills and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can also lower your
              disposal costs by creating less waste that needs to be transported to a landfill or composting facility.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Develop Better Food Waste Habits</h2>
            <p>As the digester processes food waste, it sends timely diversion and utilization data to the BioHiTech Cloud. The
              platform generates analytics and reports that you can use to change your behaviors. You can see the amount of
              food that the digester processes each day and use this data to identify trends and habits in how you manage food
              waste.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Lower Your Impact on the Environment</h2>
            <p>If you have digesters at multiple locations, the BioHiTech Cloud will compare their performance so you can set
              food waste goals for the entire organization. Encourage your team to minimize the food waste they generate in
              order to optimize resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions. You can achieve both sustainability and budget
              objectives by procuring less food and making smarter, more informed buying decisions.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Benefits of the Revolution Series Digesters</h2>
            <p>Our food waste digesters and data analytics platform help you manage your food waste’s effects on the
              environment. Additional advantages include:</p>
            <div class="content">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Capacity:</strong>&nbsp;Every digester model can process hundreds of pounds of waste per
                  day. Our
                  largest model has a capacity of more than one ton. With BioHiTech Cloud, you can see how the machine
                  is
                  working and its availability in real time.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong>&nbsp;Using the digester involves a few simple steps — the machine
                  takes care
                  of the rest. You’ll also get ongoing support from our team members for maintenance and
                  troubleshooting.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong>&nbsp;We offer a variety of rental and purchase plans to make our
                  digesters
                  accessible and budget-friendly. When you rent a digester, you also get the BioHiTech Cloud service.
