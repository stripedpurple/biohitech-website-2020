              Digester: A Food Waste Reduction System</h2>
            <p>In 2017, more food went to landfills and combustion facilities than any other type of
              material,&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/united-states-2030-food-loss-and-waste-reduction-goal"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the EPA</a>. This trend impacts climate change as
              well as an organization’s budget. By reducing your food waste, you can manage your resources in a more
              sustainable way and do your part to help the environment. BioHiTech digesters use cloud technology and real-time
              data insights to help businesses divert food waste from landfills.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Diverting Food Waste From Landfills With the Revolution Series</h2>
            <p>At BioHiTech Global, our on-site food waste digesters use a combination of warm water,
              oxygen and natural microorganisms to break down food waste into a liquid that drains down the sewer line to the
              wastewater treatment center. The process involves no grinding, chemicals or enzymes and does not generate any
              solids.</p>
            <p>Revolution Series digesters reduce your need to compost or take waste to a landfill. As
              a result, you can smartly manage your food waste and optimize your use of resources.</p>
            <h2 class="title">How to Reduce Waste in Landfills With Your Digester</h2>
            <p>Data sets BioHiTech digesters apart from the competition. The BioHiTech Cloud is a
              powerful data analytics platform that collects information from each of your digesters, detailing how much food
              waste they are diverting. Real-time data analytics empower you to:</p>
            <p>Get critical insights on your food waste: With BioHiTech Cloud, you can see the amount
              of food waste that you process every day. If you have more than one digester, you can compare performance
              between them. Change your food waste habits: Data insights enable you to make smarter food procurement
              decisions. Compare your business data to your digester data and buy less of the food items that are being
              disposed of most frequently. Improve your business operations: BioHiTech Cloud’s insights tell you which food
              products generate the most waste, so you can determine the menu items that customers prefer. Daily reports can
              help you run a more sustainable, cost-effective business through smarter food waste management habits.</p>
