In a survey related to the report, many business owners didn’t fully grasp how the industrial internet would impact their industries. Those adopting IoT are just beginning to understand its’ full possibilities."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The management and cost of waste affects every business and every industry.

Like the hotel guests of years ago, they need to be educated on the value, and environmental impact of food waste diversion. With the ability to gather the data showing the positive impacts of food waste diversion, we can foresee a future scenario where customers would expect, and look for numbers related to food waste. Some of these customers, looking to reduce their own impact on the environment, may choose to patronize a specific restaurant or chain based on documented information showing that food waste from that restaurant is not going into the landfill."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"As IoT growth continues, sustainability supported by data is a strategy hoteliers and other businesses will use to boost sales, increase loyalty, and create new branding opportunities.

For example, according to an employee training website, some of the best practices for internal gamification include something earned, such as points or badges, in exchange for prizes that are tangible, (gift cards, time off etc.) but for gamification to work, you need to have specific goals and be able to show employees how those are measured. Without the data to show how well employees are doing, it is impossible to create an incentive program that works."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Access to data enables businesses to drive a measurable and positive impact in the areas of sustainability, performance, and behavior either individually or in groups.
