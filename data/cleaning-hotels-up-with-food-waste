Watching the kitchens, restaurants and bars operate like clockwork, all in the name of providing the customer with the very best service and experience, is what often makes the quality of hotel staff some of the very best across the wider hospitality market. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"When you delve a little deeper into how the back of house operations are run, you notice that the staff and managers have their work cut out in ensuring that areas are kept clean, waste is collected and removed promptly and that all of these responsibilities are managed within tight budgets. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"It is the area of waste and how it is managed that becomes particularly interesting to understand. When you factor in that medium to large hotels in the UK produce between 80 and 350 tonnes of food waste alone per year and that the way in which they manage their waste can in most cases be vastly different.

In some cases there are those hotels that do not separate there waste at all and everything goes into general waste.

There are numerous costs that make up the price that hotels are charged to have their waste collected. When you factor in fuel and running costs of vehicles, the costs involved in separating the waste at recycling plants and then the charges from landfill sites to dispose of the remaining waste, plus the margin that the waste collection company needs to add on to make it worth their while, it is no wonder that waste collection charges are so high. Not to mention the cost to the environment from diesel and green house gas emissions emitted during the process.
