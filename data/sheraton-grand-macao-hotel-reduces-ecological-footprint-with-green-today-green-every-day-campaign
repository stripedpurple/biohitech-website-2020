Guests who take part in MAGC will enjoy 250 Starpoints, MOP40 in dining credit, late-check out at 2:00pm (subject to availability), and complimentary welcome drinks at selected hotel restaurants.

Water-saving taps and showerheads were installed across the property in back of house (BOH) working spaces. Inside taps and showerheads are aerators, which limit water flow and help to reduce water usage. These devices were installed in kitchens (only 4L/min), pantries (only 4L/min), BOH toilets (only 3L/min), and changing rooms. Using CCMS, the hotel was able to monitor overall water usage and reduction.
