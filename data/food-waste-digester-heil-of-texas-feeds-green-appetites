Reta says it involves a little more work to sort out the food waste from the non-organic trash after bussing tables, but his staff supports it 100 percent. “Our staff is completely behind it,” he says. “They like anything that is green and are very enthusiastic about the new system.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"A business that produces 47 tons of waste a month spends more than $6,800 each month disposing of it in the conventional way, Guiterrez says.

The company opened a local office in 2006 to support the heavy waste-disposal equipment it was selling to the City of San Antonio. In 2008, the company built a 17,000 square-foot facility in Northeast San Antonio at a cost of $1.3 million, Dugi says. About one-third of the space is for offices and the rest is for servicing equipment and parts. Heil of Texas’ San Antonio office employs 11 people and had between $10 million and $11 million in gross revenues last year. Companywide, the business employs about 45 people and had about $30 million in annual revenues this past year. In addition to the digester, the company sells a variety of garbage and recycling trucks that load from the front, rear or side; street sweepers; road patchers and baling equipment."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Dugi says there had been a lull in sales the past year, but things have been picking back up recently. “We have pretty much grown every year since we opened, with the exception of last year,” he says. “Now we are catching up with the prior year.” Dugi says he expects sales of the Eco-Safe Digester to boost the business in the future. “We want to spread the word about this type of machine,” he says. “The whole world is going green.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","marks":[{"type":"link","attrs":{"href":"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/print-edition/2011/12/23/food-waste-digester-heil-of-texas.html","target":null}}],"text":"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/print-edition/2011/12/23/food-waste-digester-heil-of-texas.html"}]}]},"source":"San Antonio Business Journal:  The whole world is going green"}
