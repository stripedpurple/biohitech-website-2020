Roughly one-third of the food produced globally for human consumption is lost or wasted — about 1.3 billion tonnes per year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. “The UN has estimated that 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 66 per cent by 2050,” said Mervyn Jones, Director of Sustainable Global Resources. “There is therefore a direct correlation between the population of cities and the amount of food waste generated.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The issue will be examined at the Clean Enviro Summit running in Singapore from July 11-13, in conjunction with the World Cities Summit and the Singapore International Water Week.
