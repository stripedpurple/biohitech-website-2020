It uses mechanical and biological treatments to convert food waste into a liquid that is safely discharged through standard sewer lines. During the process, the digester weighs each increment of waste, allows users to quantify its type and origin, and then immediately transmits the data to the BioHitech Cloud™—a technology platform hosted by Amazon that measures key metrics to optimize the food waste disposal process. The Eco-Safe Digester is available in three models that feature a self contained, continual feed and quiet operation: Eco-Safe 4 (45¾”L x 50″H x 35½”D), Eco-Safe 8 (59¾”L x 55¼”H x 44¼”D), and Eco-Safe 12 (69¼”L x 55¼”H x 44¼”D). No solids are generated, no chemicals are used, and no airborne contaminants are present. To use the Eco-Safe Digester users open the hatch door, add food waste, and close the door. Installation requires hot/cold water lines with mixing valve, a dedicated disconnect box, and access to a floor drain."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","marks":[{"type":"link","attrs":{"href":"http://facilityexecutive.com/2015/08/focus-on-waste-management/","target":null}}],"text":"http://facilityexecutive.com/2015/08/focus-on-waste-management/"},{"type":"hard_break"}]}]},"source":"Facility Executive:  Eco-Safe Digester by BioHitech America"}
