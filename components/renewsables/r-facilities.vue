          <h2 class="title">BioHiTech HEBioT™</h2>
          <p>Providing a proven, cost-effective, clean alternative to landfills for the disposal of solid waste
            throughout the United States. The High Efficiency Biological Treatment (HEBioT™) process, developed and
            patented by our European partners Entsorga Fin SpA, utilizes a combination of automated sorting equipment,
            enhanced biological composting, and mechanical refinement to convert waste into an EPA recognized, clean
            alternative fuel while achieving as much as 80% landfill diversion.</p>

          <p>The BioHiTtech HEBioT technology is ideal for municipalities, regional waste haulers, large generators of
            food waste and corporations with Zero Waste initiatives.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Our first facility in the USA</h2>


          <p>Our West Virginia facility is the nation’s first resource recovery facility in the United States to utilize
            Entsorga Italia’s patented HEBioT ™ process. The facility recovers biomass, plastics and other carbon-based
            materials from the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) stream and converts them into an EPA recognized
            renewable fuel. During the process recyclable commodities such as metals are extracted and recovered in
            conjunction with Berkeley County’s current recycling program.</p>

          <p>The renewable fuel, known as Solid Recovered Fuel, will be used by large energy users and co-processing
            facilities like cement manufacturers and steel mills as a cost-effective alternative or supplement to fossil
            fuels.</p>
