          <h2 class="title">Rapid Complete Elimination</h2>

          <p>Altapure’s process delivers complete elimination of viruses, bacteria, and bacterial spores, in less than 10
            minutes of exposure. Treated surfaces have been clinically proven to show <span class="is-italic">“no growth”</span> for bacterial spores,
            vegetative bacteria, and viruses.</p>

          <p>An independent laboratory has established that the Altapure process has a D-Value of 2.3 – 2.6 minutes
            (meaning 90% elimination within only 2.3 to 2.6 minutes of treatment) for Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores.
            Eliminating G. stearothermophilus indicates a similar elimination for Clostridium difficile. Altapure’s treatment
            process is rapid, providing room turnovers in under fifty (50) minutes (Exit to Entry) for a common patient
            room.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Remote Operation</h2>

          <p>The AP-4 ™ is remotely operated using a small and lightweight, hand held “Control Tablet” that is touch
            screen activated. It communicates via wireless means with one or more AP-4 ™ machines and ancillary devices.
            The wireless Control Tablet is approved for use in all medical, industrial, and scientific environments.</p>
          <p>The Control Tablet displays system status including all fluid levels, and has thermal paper printer
            capability for cycle validation. The Control Tablet can also wirelessly connect to a PC, for data and report
            downloads. If lost or damaged, the Control Tablet is easy and economical to replace.</p>
          <p>Remote operation allows the AP-4 ™ to be operated and monitored from outside of the treated space,
            eliminating the interaction between your staff and the high-level disinfection process.</p>
