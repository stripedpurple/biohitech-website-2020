From there, I began traveling around the United States to meet with chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) of waste and recycling companies to help them grow their businesses, whether it was through refinancing and consolidation of equipment loans, financing for new equipment to support newly awarded contracts or financing tuck-in acquisitions or buyouts by private equity firms. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about the industry both from the financial side as well as from the operating side.

You can’t identify and reduce what you’re wasting if you can’t measure and manage it, so I think going forward, we’ll see a greater focus by the industry, led by the end customer, for technologies that support measuring and managing what we’re wasting, recycling, diverting, etc. Also, I think having this information in real time will be the next growing evolution because everyone is pushing to be more sustainable, more green and more thoughtful in real time."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Waste360: Your 40 Under 40 award nomination mentioned that you never go anywhere without your notebook.

While one digester diverting 500 pounds of food waste a day might not seem like a lot, putting 10 of those digesters together equates to about 5,000 pounds of food waste being diverted each day. At the end of the year, this equates to more than 1.8 million pounds of food waste diverted from landfills, and that is just for 10 digesters. We have hundreds deployed across the world. As we sell and distribute more and more of our digesters, this has a compounding effect on the amount of food waste we can keep out of landfills, resulting in a positive impact on our environment and making our world better for generations to come. That really makes me excited every day."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"The second thing is the challenges I face in my role.

Lee Shelton, head of sales at The Filta Group, describes: “Over 10 million tonnes of food and drink waste is produced each year in the UK, according to the government, and worldwide this figure ramps up to 1.3 billion tonnes."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"When it comes to waste management, the issue literally goes much deeper than what foodservice operators do with their untouched leftovers and out-of-date vegetables. They have to seriously consider what happens with the by-products of cleaning cooking equipment and dishes — the fat, the oil, the grease. Research shows more than 70% of drain blockages within a commercial kitchen are caused by the build-up of FOG generated from washing pots, pans and plates — blockages which can cause kitchen closures, rancid odours and unwanted pests.”"}]},{"type":"heading","attrs":{"level":3},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"2.

Weighing up the total cost of a solution"}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Meiko’s Paul Anderson says that operators need to take time to evaluate the true cost of running a piece of equipment. “Both grey water and compost systems generate cost for the energy and chemicals they use to convert the food. There is also a long list of food that cannot go into these machines such as bones, fibrous materials such as pineapple tops, oils and fats and liquids, which means you need to separate them out, creating an extra labour requirement.”"}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"He says that operators that may not have enough of a volume to justify buying a full handling solution can still massively cut costs and labour by using ‘old’ technology such as dewatering systems, which can cut waste volume by up to 80%."}]},{"type":"heading","attrs":{"level":3},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"7. The power of transparency"}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Many of the latest food waste solutions use technology to monitor and record the level of food waste that kitchens produce.

The common misunderstanding of what the problem is leads us to reach for limited and outdated solutions that are just band aids, not getting to the core of the real problem. The fact that Americans go hungry in the face of overproduction and the subsequent waste of food, is a tragic and unnecessary problem. The priority of the restaurant, grocery, food manufacturers, maritime and food services companies should be to prevent and/or minimize the waste by initiatives that attempt to “right size” the production of food and put any resulting edible “waste” to good use for human consumption or converted to energy."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"In the entire supply chain of food production there are other unnecessary problems.

The effluent from the digesters has taken the food waste from a solid to a liquid—the first step that is required at wastewater treatment facilities, which have anaerobic digesters as part of their process. Because the digester has completed this first step for the wastewater treatment facility, the facility will use less energy to convert it into energy.

In more recent times, traditional methods to control pests often involve poisonous chemicals that are expensive to deploy and potentially harmful to the people living there as well as the environment. But at the same time these cities continue to wage a war against disease carrying pests like rats and other rodents, they are rolling out what is essentially a daily curbside buffet for these pests in the form of half-eaten meals and discarded or expired food that sits in garbage bags left on city streets for collection. Solutions like better waste containers and more frequent garbage pickups have been largely ineffective at curbing the alarming growth rate in urban rat populations, as persistent rodents have been known to chew through just about anything that gets in their way to get the food they need."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"While the rodent problem in major cities continues to persist, the news is not all bad. In the past decade, an increasing number of states are beginning to add food to the list of mandatory recyclables required by law and some major cities like New York have begun launching a more aggressive opposition against the rats. But no matter what attempts they make, the most accurate assessment in regard to controlling the rodent population should be credited to New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, “The best way to eliminate rats is to deprive them of food.”"}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"A major part of the solution to New York City’s rat infestation may lie in the Mayor’s Zero Waste plan. As part of that plan, the City passed legislation in 2016 requiring certain high volume businesses, like food manufacturers, arenas, and hotels with more than 150 rooms, to divert organic waste from the traditional waste stream destined for landfill. In February of this year, the City expanded that legislation to include large footprint food retailers and restaurants as well as chain restaurants like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks where multiple locations within the five boroughs have a common owner. By diverting more organics, New York City hopes to solve a number of issues associated with food waste disposal and, as is usually the case, technology is lending a hand. Technologies that address food waste at the point of generation are beginning to gain traction as a viable solution for achieving any “Zero Waste” plan. By addressing the organic waste at the point of generation, it is possible to not only take it from the waste stream, but also eliminate it as a source of food to fuel rodent population growth."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Our New York based technology company, BioHiTech, offers a cost effective on-site food waste disposal solution that may be the key to achieving both objectives with the added benefit of helping to reduce overall waste generation through supply chain data analytics. BioHiTech utilizes on-site Aerobic digestion, an approved alternative solution for food waste disposal, that basically digests food scraps and most organic waste resulting in a liquid discharge that is safely eliminated through standard sewer lines, bypassing the traditional trip to the dumpster or curb for pickup. Additionally, if those sewer lines lead to an advanced wastewater treatment facility the discharge can ultimately be used as a fuel source to generate renewable energy and to produce beneficial fertilizers."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"And we take traditional aerobic digestion one step further, by helping our customers become smarter about the waste they are generating through actionable information. We developed the BioHiTech Cloud, a sophisticated data analytics platform, making BioHiTech the only aerobic digestion company that provides its customers with access to real-time data. Each BioHiTech digester is equipped with a built-in scale and internet connected technology that enables our customers to track their disposal process in real-time to ensure no food waste is improperly disposed while simultaneously providing regulators with accurate data to help track the results of their imposed regulation. The data can also help our customers better manage their supply chain by making them smarter about what they are throwing out. We view this information technology as one of the key factors in achieving Zero Waste."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Waste management is one of the most time-intensive and frustrating tasks endured by food service employees. It’s difficult, it’s messy and it’s expensive. Digesters can remove food waste from dumpsters or the curb, eliminating unwanted vermin and odors as well as relieving many of the demands on housekeeping. As more and more businesses, cities and neighborhoods seek to address their needs for sustainable food waste disposal solutions to help combat rodent infestation, we offer an affordable and effective solution to safely control food waste and maybe even a way to finally win the pest control battle."}]}]}}

Food waste, the predominant SSO in the commercial organics stream, is wet and heavy leading to financial and logistical challenges when trucking it from the generator to an often distant processing facility. This reality has led to opportunities for on-site processing systems that either: 1) Substantially reduce the weight and volume of the organics prior to hauling; or 2) Biologically break down and liquefy the organics to the point that they can be disposed through the existing sanitary sewer system, eliminating hauling for this waste stream altogether. This dynamic has led to many organics generators being solicited with increasing frequency by on-site system vendors, particularly in states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and California, which are at the forefront of implementing organics diversion policies. For generators subject to upcoming organics disposal bans (see “Massachusetts Sets the Table for an Organics Ban,” December 2012) and who are not already separating their organics for composting, on-site solutions appear to be a veritable “silver bullet.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"As SSO generators and facility managers attempt to obtain information about on-site systems independent of the sales calls and marketing claims, they can encounter difficulty finding objective comparative studies that discuss the range of available options applicable to their site-specific considerations.

Additionally, the systems are often seen by generators as a relatively simple, low-maintenance option, particularly when transitioning from a non-source separating system where organics are mixed with MSW. Of particular interest to most ICI kitchens is the perceived cost differential between traditional source separating and hauling of organics versus on-site management. The challenge for on-site solutions providers becomes one of presenting a system that lives up to the product claims including reliability, ease of use, accurate costs for water and electricity use, permitting requirements and composition of the residual liquid or solid.

Unfortunately this ever-changing landscape makes it very difficult for potential customers to conduct independent due diligence. Confirmation of product promises is complicated by the fact that many of these systems are distributed by resellers, equipment leasing companies and waste consultants (separate from direct distribution), who often change the system that they sell/lease for a myriad of reasons.

(An exception is EnviroPure, which claims its “BioMix does not contain any microbes, bacteria or enzymes“ but instead is comprised of minerals, nutrients, amino acids and vitamins.) The additives in these systems essentially accelerate the decomposition process and, with the addition of incremental amounts of water, transform the organic solids into a liquid within a 24-hour period.

After interviewing multiple wastewater authorities at municipal and district levels, regulatory officials have either limited knowledge of these systems or, at best, a very generalized understanding of what they do and how they do it. Biodigester companies are generally encountering little permitting resistance when installing their systems as they often characterize the install as ”replacing an existing fixture“ such as a slop sink, which requires no permitting.

As authorities become more aware of the potential for problematic new effluent discharges into their sewer systems, a serious concern arises regarding potential damage to the plumbing systems over time. Wastewater from industries that generate large amounts of food waste tend to carry high levels of chemical and biological pollutants, especially BOD. When mixed in a sanitary sewer system with sulfates, normally present in the human digestive track, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), can be formed. H2S is a corrosive and acidic gas that can corrode pipes — not a desirable outcome for those responsible for maintaining plumbing and wastewater systems.

Biodigester vendors use the claim, “waste to water.” All of the biodigester systems included in this study claim significant BOD and total suspended solids (TSS) reduction although this claim is clearly the most difficult to independently confirm because: 1) Levels vary depending on the type of initial waste fed into the machine (some organics such as dough and dairy have inherently higher BOD levels); 2) Levels are dependent on ”seed count” of the microorganisms (the amount of bacteria present at any given time); and 3) Very few independent studies of effluent characterization are publicly available.

Studies have shown that using dehydrated food waste as a soil amendment, either alone or mixed with compost, creates an environment conducive to fungus and attractive to a variety of unwelcome vectors (see “Food Waste Diversion At Urban University,” December 2011). Interviewees have indicated the key variable influencing fungus growth is the moisture content present in the residual after a full treatment cycle, which appears to vary from system to system. The other component of all dehydration systems is the liquid portion that has been captured in a vapor form, reconstituted in a vessel and then disposed via a drain. Some vendors claim that this water is potable (one salesperson is reported to actually drink the water at sales calls to prove it).

The relatively high amount of water required for biodigesters is cited by users as both cost and sustainability considerations. A key benefit cited by vendors of dehydration systems is that they effectively split the waste into its two basic components, solids and liquids, and process them separately.

Dehydrators typically do not require added water as they vaporize the liquid via high temperature, providing the generator with an organic residual that typically shows an 85 to 95 percent reduction in volume and weight. This residual, though, still requires off-site transport, which represents a discreet cost. Biodigesters, on the other hand, work by adding water to biochemically slurried waste and getting rid of it via the sewer. Although hauling is avoided with biodigesters, vendors charge for their proprietary biological additives, which are added at intervals ranging from continuously to once every three to four months. Another cost component for these systems is the required regular replacement of the media added to the vessels (wood or plastic chips) that essentially serve as a habitat for the microorganisms."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"One of the key sustainability benefits of dehydrators vs. biodigesters is that a much larger fraction of nutrient value in the organics is retained. The water that is disposed (condensate) by dehydration systems does contain BODs although these levels have not been flagged as a major concern. Effluent from biodigesters, on the other hand, is raising red flags in the wastewater community because if the liquid that is being discharged into the wastewater treatment system does, in fact, carry high levels of BOD and sludge, then the cost of the disposal is essentially being transferred from the generator to the municipal ratepayers."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"On-site organic waste solutions for larger organics generators are appealing on economic, logistical and hygienic levels, but the promise of a proverbial “silver bullet“ solution to dealing with large amounts of organics simply does not exist.

BioHitech has partnered with leading anaerobic digestion companies, including CRMC Dartmouth Bioenergy, an anaerobic digestion facility located in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to pilot its technology as a pre-processing unit for CRMC’s recently constructed facility. This facility accepts commercial/industrial food wastes, organic sludges, FOG or other liquid or slurried non-hazardous organics. The Bioenergy Facility is the first of its kind to be sited at an operating Massachusetts landfill and the first developed in the state to produce biogas for use in a pre-existing landfill gas-to-energy facility."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"As the evolution of the food waste industry progresses, on site solutions such as the Eco-Safe Digester and other similar products will become increasingly relevant to its success and paramount to other disposal methods such as anaerobic digestion and future technologies.

Not only does the technology reduce potential for injury as employees \"journey\" the wet waste to what feels like the center of the Earth on some days, but it provides a more sanitary workplace for them.

Pulping systems with dewatering presses reduce food volume up to 85%. While the remaining waste can be thrown away, pulping is an excellent option if organic waste recycling is offered in your area. Your disposal costs will decline significantly, since your waste hauler collects only 15% of the volume you formerly produced.

The units typically have paddles or agitators that continuously stir the waste (macerating it to some degree at the same time), and a heater raises the temperature inside to 180° F. Dehydrators reduce food weight and volume by up to 90%. The resulting end product (the consistency of coffee grounds), is sterilized and might be used as a feedstock for composting or as a soil amendment. But take note: no dehydrator produces an end product that can go directly onto your landscaping or be used as compost. The end product form a dehydrator needs to go through a second processing step to render it usable in a sustainable application. The dehydrated product could also have high levels of salt or acidity; either way, it will need further processing. Dehydrator literature does not always make this clear. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Food waste processed in a dehydrator also is odorless, as long as it’s kept dry, so it can be stored until a hauler picks it up. (Obviously, if it gets wet, the decomposition process starts immediately, and it will grow in volume and start to smell). The only other by-product of the process is the water that’s evaporated from the food. It’s condensed in the dehydrator’s sealed environment and can go down the drain or be used as grey water in the dishroom or on landscaping. A 250-lb. load of food waste basically ends up as 25 lb. of dry waste and 25 gal. of water. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Dehydrators are batch processors. Once filled and turned on they require 12-18 hours to fully dry a batch of food waste. Since you can’t interrupt a batch in processed, you need to judge capacity accurately, so you don’t have food waste sitting around waiting to be loaded into the unit.

Some have grinders that break food up as it goes into the digester, so they can handle shells, bones and fruit pits. All have agitators to stir the contents and help speed decomposition, but those without grinders, won’t take bones, shells or pits. Most, though not all, use water, so the units must be plumbed. Some require warm water for the process, and have heaters built in, while others only need cold water. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Biodigesters process food waste continuously so employees can keep adding scraps or food waste throughout the day. A unit’s capacity is rated at how much food it can process in 24 hours (unlike dehydrators, which may dry a particular batch of food in half that time).

It requires no drain and the end product is finished compost.

The acidity of the effluent, if too high, can be an issue for pipes, too. Depending on the organic matter you put in the units, your local water utility might turn down effluent from a digester. What water utilities worry about are potential dead spots in waterways caused by BOD; the possibility of continued enzymatic action in their sewage plants (if your digester uses enzymes); and sewer pipes clogging from effluent that emulsifies when enzymes stop working or due to FOG.

Biodigesters ten to run somewhat less, with the smallest models starting at about $16,000 and larger models (up to 2,000 lb/day) costing about $45,000.

In the U.S. alone, over $100 billion worth of food goes uneaten annually, with 98.4 percent, or more than 34 million tons, landfilled. Throughout North America, Green technology company BioHiTech Global Inc.’s subsidiary, BioHiTech America, is installing digestion technology that reinvents food waste management by focusing on processing the waste at its point of generation for easier, more cost-effective disposal. BioHiTech named its waste processor the Eco-Safe digester, an onsite aerobic digester that eliminates up to 2,400 pounds of food waste in a 24-hour period by converting it into a nutrient-neutral grey water that’s discharged through standard sewer lines. BioHiTech has been investigating further uses for the liquid slurry by testing the transportation and use of it in an anaerobic digestion (AD) facility. “BioHiTech teamed up with Natural Systems Utilities, Ridgewood Green RME LLC and the village of Ridgewood, New Jersey, to test a process that allows BioHiTech’s Eco-Safe digester to digest, tank and deliver the effluent from its Eco-Safe digesters to anaerobic digestion facilities anywhere in the world,” says Frank Celli, CEO of BioHiTech Global. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"In order to test whether the effluent from the digester would be a good feedstock, the company installed a unit at a high-volume supermarket in New Jersey. “After testing by both BioHiTech and Natural Systems, it was determined that with some modifications to the settings on the Eco-Safe digester, the effluent would essentially complete the first step of AD, which is hydrolysis,” Celli says. He explains that hydrolysis is where the bacteria transform the particulate organics into liquid, and by adjusting the amount of microorganisms introduced into the system, the company can provide a viable feedstock that meets the needs of the AD facility."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“We’re looking to bring more of their material in on a longer-term basis,” says Richard Cisterna, executive vice president of business development with Natural Systems Utilities. Ridgewood Green—composed of NSU, American Refining and Biochemical, and Middlesex Water Company—entered into a public private partnership with the village of Ridgewood on the waste-to-energy project. The Ridgewood Green facility is located at the village’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which includes a 20,000 gallon-per-day liquid waste receiving facility. Outside organic wastes are brought to the facility and codigested in two digesters with municipal biosolids that are generated at the WWTP. The resulting biogas is used in a combined-heat-and-power system with the capacity to generate 240 kilowatts of electricity and 1.5 million Btu per hour of thermal heat, equaling almost all of the WTTP’s required energy. Waste heat recovered from the engine is used to optimize the AD process by heating the sludge.

He adds that this demonstration will give BioHiTech the ability to deploy more of their systems at commercial facilities, especially in light of food waste generators’ obligation in certain jurisdictions to abide by legislation banning food waste from landfills. Currently, there are food waste diversion bans from landfills already in effect in Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York City and, according to Cisterna, it’s being proposed now in New York and New Jersey, states that NSU is very active in. “We are participating in promoting that,” he shares."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Since the Eco-Safe digester completes the hydrolysis step of the anaerobic process prior to arrival at the AD facility, Celli says this assists with blending other feedstocks into the process. “It breaks down the material and liquefies it so it’s more readily digestible by our anaerobic digesters,” Cisterna adds. The liquefied state also makes it easier to transport."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"In a way, the system is geared toward enhancing a hub-and-spoke model of handling biogas feedstocks by predigesting food waste onsite at the source (the spoke) which can then be transported to a central AD plant (the hub) for energy generation. “The way it’s contemplated now is they would arrange for the hauling to pick up that liquid material from multiple locations, and they would haul the material to our facility at the waste water treatment plant,” Cisterna says."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"According to Celli, tanking of the effluent will be done on a case-by-case basis. “The economics of distance to an AD facility and trucking the effluent have to add up to a positive,” he says. “We are working with customers who have sustainability goals to determine if the environmental benefits of producing energy are balanced with the distance and impacts of trucking.” In many instances, Celli adds, there are positive impacts, but for those where an AD plant is too far away, discharge to the sanitary sewer can accomplish many sustainability goals as well. "},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Prior to discharge into a sanitary sewer line or a collection tank, the digester weighs each increment of waste and allows users to qualify its type and origin, and then immediately transmits the data to BioHiTech Cloud.

But while we should all try to achieve this goal, the reality is that donating food is much harder than it should be, for a variety of reasons, and not all food waste is recoverable for human consumption or animal feed. Absent better infrastructure to get this food to those in need, supermarkets and other businesses must make sure that when they are disposing of food waste, they are doing so responsibly and effectively.

Therefore, there is lease revenue already being used to benefit the county’s litter-control and recycling programs.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"How it Works"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Essentially, waste will be delivered in standard waste-collection trucks.

Step one involves the initial reception, where a primary mechanical/automated process splits the waste stream into oversize and undersize items."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Then, the undersize items move to step two: the bio-oxidation (or stabilization) hall—where moisture is reduced (up to 40 percent of waste volume is moisture) using a patented reverse-flow air system. The floor is perforated beneath with a system of stainless steel piping—enabling the facility to pull air down through the waste. That air is then circulated, and periodically, via software, reversed—similar to a convection oven—thus accelerating the stabilization of the organics. When the software detects the desired results, the batch is moved to the third and final step."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“The third step is what we call mechanical refinement,” explained Frank Celli, a board member at Entsorga, CEO at BioHiTech, and chairman of the board and part owner at Apple Valley Waste (he wears a lot of hats). “We remove metals, PVC [plastic], shred, the trommel screens, and ultimately, we’ll take that stabilized waste and split it into standard recyclables, PVC products, and inert materials (dirt, dust, glass)—with the remaining material (high-BTU: paper, plastics, etc.) being what we call solid recovered fuel (SRF). Somewhere between forty to forty-five percent of what comes into the facility will be converted into an engineered fuel.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Recent headlines have indicated that the Grapevine Road endeavor is the nation’s first mechanical biological treatment waste-to-fuel facility. “To our knowledge, this facility is the nation’s first waste-to-SRF facility,” Celli noted. “There are facilities that are making refuge-derived fuel (RDF). The difference between that and us is under the terms of our EPA comfort letter. The byproduct of this facility is an engineered fuel; there’s a lot of money, time, and intellectual property that goes into creating it—so it’s different from RDF. When we say ‘nation’s first’ to convert municipal solid waste into a solid recovered fuel approved by the EPA, we are the first, to our knowledge. We use a proprietary biological treatment to produce an EPA-approved engineered fuel.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The Finished Product"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"In the end, the engineered fuel, which takes anywhere from 10-14 days to process, basically looks like party confetti. “It’s a shredded fluff mixture of dried paper and plastic,” said Hogbin."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"That shredded fluff, however, has a very important use, added Celli. “The fuel will be used as a supplement or substitute for coal. It’s light and fluffy because it’s completely dry and stable. It’ll be fed with an air system—so it’s actually blown into the kiln when in use (versus a conveyor belt), which is why it needs to be light and fluffy.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The primary customer, for now, is Argos Cement—formerly Essroc Cement—based in Martinsburg.

Argos has an international name in sustainability—so I guess a lot of stars aligned.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The Essroc facility, at the time, had recently undergone a major retrofit, and they had a desire to lower their carbon footprint and use an alternative fuel. They were accustomed to using such fuel in Europe, but it’s relatively new to the U.S. At the same time, Martinsburg’s only landfill was nearing capacity.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“The Berkeley County folks, Clint Hogbin, offered up the old landfill site—they’re very progressive—and I can’t say enough about them,” emphasized Celli. “It made sense; we had demand for fuel in the market—we had a surplus of municipal feedstock that had to leave the market. So, a cost-effective local disposal opportunity that could manufacture a renewable fuel to be able to close the loop and use that fuel right in the county where the waste is generated was a great solution on the local level, and a great model for what we can do throughout the U.S. as we move forward with sustainability initiatives involving waste.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Celli is a believer that the U.S. will ultimately look more like Europe sooner than later in the way that it deals with municipal solid waste. “Clean tech does not necessarily have to cost more money—there are products that can be deployed that are more sustainable than traditional landfilling.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"In the meantime, the Grapevine Road facility, as well as its customer, Argos Cement, will enter into a relationship that will process 88,000 tons of municipal solid waste per year.

It’s fully automated—it basically looks like a FedEx warehouse. It’s very exciting to be starting this up in West Virginia. It represents a viable, cost-effective solution for municipal solid waste disposal in areas that don’t have the luxury of proximity to landfills with years of life on them."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“That said, we’re only going to put twenty percent of the incoming material back in the landfill—so we’re really helping to extend its life, in addition to the other benefits.

If you have a good blend of food then you’ll have a pretty neutral pH.

If you look at the life cycle analysis that the University of Delaware did, they did a comparative study between the aerobic digesters and anaerobic digesters, composting and then landfill disposal. The aerobic digesters came out “far and away” as the most environmentally friendly from a greenhouse gas perspective. If you had to put them in order I’d say out of the four things evaluated in the life cycle assessment that the digester would be first, followed by the anaerobic digester, followed by composting, followed by landfilling.

If your using trucks, and trucks are driving a hundred or more miles to dispose of it, you’ve lost any environmental benefit. BioHiTech has been doing research on the digesters for years now. I joined BioHiTech three years ago, and we’ve certainly been doing a lot of in depth research since then to ensure that the effluent that we generate can be put through the sanitary sewer. We’ve evaluated safety to workers. We’ve done studies to make sure that there are not any off gases, like methane, from the digester. The only time methane is present is in the absence of oxygen. So, because we are an aerobic digester there is no methane. If you look at anaerobic digestion they’re capturing the methane. They’re using it to create energy. At landfills, if you go and look on the internet, you can find websites that talk about what facilities are actually using methane gas vs. ones that aren’t and are just flaring the gas.

We are at the very start, educating people using the analytics that are on our machine to have them understand the waste they generate. Then they can start looking at their menus and saying, “Oh wow, breakfast. Tuesdays must really not be very good because we throw most of it away.” They can start changing their practices. We start by education and trying to change people’s methods. Then the next thing is just using the existing infrastructure. We use the sanitary sewer and the wastewater treatment of plants, and there’s beneficial output on that. And on the end of it, we have reusable commodity. Waste becomes a commodity at that point.

BioHiTech Global is a New York- based technology company led by environ- mental service industry experts, taking different approach to solving these problems. BioHiTech has focused on deploying cost-effective, sustainable technology solutions that can be easily integrated with traditional disposal methods. The Company’s CEO, Frank E.
