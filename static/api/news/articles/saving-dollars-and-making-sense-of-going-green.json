There are five categories: Site development, store efficiency, healthy indoors, sustainable operations, and innovation and Community. Strategies for each are scored according to a Dunkin’ audit. A Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant that receives 12 points earns DD Green status; if it receives 20, the shop earns Green Elite status.

West Orange, New Jersey is where Thomas Alva Edison had his laboratories and his family home.

So, when the chance came up to move down the block, Goldman grabbed the opportunity and decided it would be worth building a sustainable shop that would qualify as DD Green.
