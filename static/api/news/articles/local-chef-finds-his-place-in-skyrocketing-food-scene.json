When his partner, James Steiner, was recruited by Trevor Burgess, then CEO of the former C1 Bank, to work at the bank — Steiner eventually became chief risk officer — the couple moved to St. Petersburg.

So I’m instilling that idea in the restaurant, using everything local, everything seasonal where I can,” Jew said. “I grew up with a lot of dim sum and the restaurant will be breakfast, lunch and dinner so there will be some aspect of that dim sum as well as other Chinese ingredients in the menu."}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"“Also, there’s not a really spectacular Chinese-focused restaurant in the downtown area, so that was another plus for me.”"}]},{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Lingr will have a very Nordic feel with clean lines and a marble bar that to Jew resembles an iceberg.
