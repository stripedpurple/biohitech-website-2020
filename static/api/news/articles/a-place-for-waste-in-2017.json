Once in the landfill, this food slowly decomposes, emitting large volumes of methane, a particularly harmful greenhouse gas and contributor to global climate change. What many people may not realize is that landfills produce 20 percent of the total U.S. methane emissions."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"In response to these troubling statistics, some action has already been taken - on the national and statewide level - to reduce impacts both environmentally and economically. In September, 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and EPA announced the first ever domestic goal to reduce food loss and waste by half by the year 2030 and currently five states and three cities have their own legislative goals and specific restrictions to more properly manage food waste forcing businesses and municipalities to make changes.

To comply with the new law, many businesses have turned to on-site solutions like aerobic digestion. Other municipalities, like Berkeley County, West Virginia, are adopting technologies that convert incoming solid and food waste into clean alternative fuel.

If done correctly, waste diversion can be attractive for everyone as businesses can cut costs and minimize inefficiencies, fewer garbage trucks will be on the roads, and sparse landfill space will be salvaged.
