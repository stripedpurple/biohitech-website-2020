Often, clients are surprised because they weren’t aware how much it was costing them,” said Rafael Rivera, director of recycling and janitorial operations at Garbage Becoming Green (GBG), a pioneering leader in the design and implementation of waste-management and recycling programs for the commercial sector in Puerto Rico. “Of course, they are also relieved to know they can count on us to provide them with solutions that fit their needs and budgets, and this helps them manage their waste and comply with environmental laws and statutes.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"To develop a tailor-made plan for a client, Rivera said the GBG team reviews the operation’s waste production patterns, taking into consideration factors such as how much waste the operation produces in general or is produces by its tenants, what type of waste and in what time span the operation produces the most or least waste, among other concerns.
