All you have to do is segregate your food waste, we then put it in the machine, the lifter dumps it inside, there are enzymes and a bacteria cocktail that digests the food.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"It’s like a giant mechanical stomach and out the other end comes grey water.
