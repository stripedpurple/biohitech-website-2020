Decimate one head, and two more heads will grow in its place. But unlike the hydra, climate change is real. To defeat the beast, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and inhibition of the release of pollutants to the environment are not enough. For climate change solutions to work, regenerative actions to reverse the damage and clean up the environment must be pursued as well. Experts predict that we only have about a decade to carry out policies and climate change solutions. If we move too late, then we must brace ourselves for cataclysmic impact. Nevertheless, companies saving the environment today are coming to light."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"With large swathes of forests ravaged by wildfires, coastal areas wiped out by super typhoons and hurricanes, and nations suffering from water crisis and food shortage—the call to act now has never been louder and clearer.
