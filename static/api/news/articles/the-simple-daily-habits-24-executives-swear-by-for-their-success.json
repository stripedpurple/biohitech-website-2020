I've polled countless executives about the things they're doing every day which give them an edge, and certain themes have surfaced over time. These high achievers often get up early, proactively manage their health and practice mindfulness, as opposed to flitting from one electronic task to another while neglecting important human relationships. Check out these quotes from 24 high achieving individuals who talk about some of these simple daily habits--and many other good ones--for helping them get ahead in business and life."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"1.

When you take a step back and realize how little time you actually spend with your family, it should make you want to make it count.

I update the white board on a regular basis adjusting for what I have mentally processed each day. In addition to prioritizing, I use the whiteboard for multiple business activities including brainstorming sessions, strategy meetings, new business development ideas, new client contracts, and more. The white board will cover major developments right down to small details that I think are important to either me or the company.

Visualization is such a powerful tool. If you can see it, you are half way there. Lastly, get yo ass into a gym!...or outside. Run, jump, box, yoga, swim, do something to get the blood flowing.

Taking this approach is extremely helpful in creating more bandwidth for you as well as the company.
