Gold Medal Environmental, based in Sewell, New Jersey, is working to change that through its innovative organic waste solutions.

The study examined four food waste management pathways: transporting aerobically digested waste through the sewer to a wastewater treatment plant for further treatment; trucking aerobically digested waste to an anaerobic digester for further treatment and conversion into energy; trucking the waste to a landfill for disposal; and trucking the waste to a compost facility for further treatment."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"The study concluded that releasing wastewater into the sewer is an environmentally favorable pathway and “takes advantage of the existing wastewater treatment infrastructure.” However, continued research needs to be done to fully vet the effects of the digester outflow, “which may help future stakeholders feel more confident in the product.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“With new technology, there are always questions and hesitations,” Schmidt says. “One of the biggest questions we hear is centered on exactly what is being sent down the drain when you use an aerobic digester. The University of Delaware study found as microorganisms go down the drain with the food, they help clean the pipes of grease buildup as they make their way to the wastewater treatment facility. It’s not wrecking the ecosystem. It’s helping the process.”"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"Cloud-based technology that comes with the digesters allows Gold Medal customers to share live data to engage the community and inspire behavioral change."},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"hard_break"},{"type":"text","text":"“Customers go online [and] pull information that tells them how many pounds of food waste they diverted from the landfill that day, week or year.
