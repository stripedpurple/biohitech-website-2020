One of the many areas we are assessing in which they can reduce their carbon footprint besides LED lightbulbs and traditional recycling is by diverting their organic waste. We have already gone through an assessment process, and know the volume of organic waste being produced, and are now in the evaluation process of a solution. We are not looking for a consultation at this point, but only general pricing. The following shows monthly averages of different volume stores's organic waste on a monthly basis. \r\n\r\n14 Stores: 9 Tons/Month\r\n36 Stores: 6 Tons/Month\r\n22 Stores: 2 Tons/Month\r\n\r\nBased on this information, it appears to me that your smallest model, the Eco-Safe 4 would handle the volume of the smallest to the largest of our stores. Can you give me general pricing on how much this machine costs to purchase, shipping, installation, and how much does it cost to operate on a monthly basis with Electricity, Water, and any supplies necessary for the digestion process. I know pricing will not be exact, but based on national averages.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm only looking for general pricing at this point, and if it appears that this is a feasible solution, we will be in contact to schedule an actual evaluation and assessment.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHeath Nicholas\r\nEnvironmental Consultant","date":"2014-10-25T18:16:38.479Z"}

As a small business owner myself, I thought you would really benefit from something that worked tremendously well for me, attracting a ton of traffic and new customers. It’s this new thing called a “video testimonial.” In plain English, it’s basically a mini commercial for your biz, but you can write your own script, choose your own actor, and it’s pretty darn cheap for what you’re getting.  I tried it out for my own biz and it turned out great. It’s like a review for your business but it looks like an actual customer did it, blogging about your product because they’re so satisfied with it. It’s the best business expenses and the best investment I’ve ever made, and you can try it out at http://www.buy-testimonials.org. Keep up the good work. - Luke.","date":"2014-11-22T01:21:45.635Z"}

{"name":"Marc Printz","email":"marc.printz@innovationcharter.org","phone":"","subject":"School Application","message":"BioHiTech,\r\n\r\nI'm Marc Printz, a high school senior at Innovation Academy Charter School in Massachusetts. It has been three years now that I have been attempting to have my school begin composting and start a garden; it seems like this year that I may actually succeed. I have done much research into different digesters on the market and am very impressed by the ones you offer (especially the cloud aspect). I plan on recommending you in my report to my school. That said, I hope you don't mind me asking a few questions.\r\n1. Can the grey water produced be used to water plants? It seemed that the digester produced by PowerKnot could.\r\n2. Can the machine handle bioplastic or paper utensils (forks, knives, plates, cups) or paper napkins?\r\n3. About how much would the Eco-Safe4 cost?\r\n4. How full does this system need to be at any given time? This would be for a High School and Middle School of 800 kids. Using outside numbers I estimate we produce 600 pounds of food waste a day (not including bioplastics), 5 days a week. This will increase when we install a garden.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarc Printz","date":"2015-02-15T21:51:14.275Z"}

I thought it would not be a big deal, because it has a 30-day money-back guarantee.\r\nThe first thing I noticed after joining was that their private Facebook communities were like nothing I had seen before. It was like having 3,000 friends encouraging and helping you on a daily basis. Actually, you would get help in seconds! Best of all, no one talked about Farmville or Candy Crush! \r\nSometimes when I had a question, I asked the Facebook group and within a few moments, I would hear that familiar ping of the Facebook notification, alerting me that someone had answered the question I had asked a second ago! It was like magic. The quality of support there is overwhelming.  Normally people quit programs because they have to do everything themselves and cannot expect much help from anybody.\r\nThis was totally worth it. I was able to recoup my investment within the first month – and I have enjoyed double-digit sales growth ever since.\r\nUnreal Experience \r\nI have seen many so-called “newbies”; turn into “Jedis” overnight. For example, I know a guy who was asking how to do this and that. I do not exactly remember what he said, but to me it sounded like a “how do you hold a pen, so I can draw?” kind of question. I was surprised to see that, last month, he posted on Facebook that he was making $9,000 a month!\r\nAnother example: At a live event, I met a nice Chinese woman who did not know much about Internet Marketing. It took her only two months to get her product going on Amazon with this program, and I recently noticed on Facebook that she is making $8,000 a month!\r\nI mean, where else can you make this kind of money?\r\nI truly believe that this is the best business model for Internet Marketers in 2015.","date":"2015-04-18T10:07:27.705Z"}

We belong to a group of 4 companies with the main company being established since 1984, and specializing in elevated work platforms. As a whole we are present in Singapore, Malaysia (Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur), and Indonesia (Jakarta and Surabaya). In Singapore alone we have 4 factories with a total workspace of approximately 100,000 square feet and a headcount of around 180.\r\n\r\nThe group has recently diversified into the clean/green tech industry with the incorporation of Enerprof Pte Ltd. It was incorporated in 2013 but only became active in August 2014. I am in charge of this division.\r\n\r\nWe believe that there is a market for food waste decomposition machines in Singapore. Our National Environment Agency has also started a push to promote its usage. However it seems that most such machines are simply different variations of the same thing, with minimal difference in functionality.\r\n\r\nThat is until I came across BioHiTech and your cloud based big data system. We feel that this is possibly a very strong selling point for the potential clients here in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIs BioHitech America open to further discussions regarding a possible partnership? I assure you that we will put our utmost best towards the promotion of Eco-Safe should discussions bear fruit. Similarly, we can possibly also add extra value to possible clients by integrating a water treatment system to the effluent such that there is greater scope of usage for the water.\r\n\r\nDo feel free to get back to me with any queries and I am looking forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOwen Yeo","date":"2015-05-12T13:58:50.784Z"}

Do you supply the british market, or are you only active on the american market? \r\n\r\n3.

To summarize, the project spotlights a neighborhood in Brooklyn where existing infrastructures have material links which could close waste loops, utilize local resources, and further benefit the surrounding community. \r\n\r\nMy topic of research is in residential food waste, how it can be used as a resource, and the environmental benefits from keeping it out of landfills. The area of subject throws out about 3,000 pounds of food a day, does not have a mandatory organics recycling program, and only voluntarily composts(on an individual level), so there has to be a better way to make use of all this food waste.\r\n\r\nCertain food waste disposal units seem convenient and clean, yet organic loading or insufficient sewer systems are real drawbacks. This is where I was especially intrigued with your product, the \"Eco-Safe Digester\", for every reason. The on-site aerobic digester, smart monitoring, and the type of effluent are distinctive qualities in this product. This digester seems like the perfect component for dealing with food waste, in the case of my project.\r\n\r\nI have some questions about the \"Eco-Safe Digester\", concerning feasibility in this specific area, the type of effluent it produces and installation. Since I think this product is a perfect suggestion for reducing the neighborhood's food waste, I would like to get some more information about it.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set up a meeting or time to speak on the phone about the \"Eco-Safe Digester\"? If this is not possible, I will be more then happy to forward complete questions.\r\n\r\nYour products are awesome and innovative. Thank you so much for taking this time to read my e-mail. I am looking forward to hearing back.\r\n\r\n-Stephanie Ingber\r\n","date":"2016-10-13T05:31:56.419Z"}

ADR specializes in the manufacturing and modification of superstructure vehicles and is the sole distributor of Carrier Truck, Trailer, and Container Refrigeration Solutions in Jordan.\r\n\r\nAs part of its 2017 business development plan, ADR is looking to explore a completely new line of business. Given the new and dynamic demographics in Jordan, partly due to the influx of refugees along with other political and social factors, overfilled and rather neglected landfills are becoming one of the main challenges for policy makers.\r\n\r\nHowever, we as ADR saw this as an opportunity rather than a setback.  \r\nSo we decided to step up and be part of the solution.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, please note that we are in the process of establishing a composting facility in Jordan to produce high-quality fertilizer purely derived from food waste. When operational, it will be the first community-based composting facility in the country. Our vision is not only to produce and sell compost, but rather to start a revolutionary awareness campaign aimed at educating people from every walk of life about the overlooked environmental risks of their wasteful habits and enlightening them on how they can become responsible citizens.\r\n\r\nThus, we are very interested in learning more about your company and your products, so as to go further.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nHadil Barghouti\r\nBusiness Development Director\r\nADR Imagine Group\r\n+96279-6000-414\r\nAmman, Jordan\r\n","date":"2016-11-09T10:55:35.847Z"}

I am not the expert on this piece of equipment nor is it my job.  I was told that I had to purchase a maintenance contract and so I did and still could not get anyone to show up and do the required repair work.  My contract has since gone out of date and my unit is still not working and I do not want to have to pay for another contract for service that I never receive.  I really need to speak to someone besides Michael Buebweno, because he is no help and only wants to trouble shoot over the telephone.  With all the money spent by the Bureau of Prisons on these machines I would think that we could get better customer service than what he has provided.  My machine will not record weight and has not recorded weight in over a year.  The light tower will go between yellow and green and will not stay running.

The RAC is researching equipment that Summit could purchase, to be used to recycle food waste.  This equipment would be situated at our Transfer Station (where things like garbage, yard clippings, and other items are taken).  At this phase we are unsure of the intended scope of the program, and whether it would be available to residential, business and commercial sectors, or only some combination of the three. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are some basic initial questions that we have for your company.  If possible, it would be best if we received written answers, and then it might be best to schedule a follow-up call to further discuss.  If you are unable to address these questions, can you identify someone who would be able to do so? \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your continued assistance.\r\n\r\nChris Sprague\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are our initial questions, with respect to your Digesters.  Please respond to the following questions, and let me know if you need additional information to answer these questions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- How long has your Digester been commercially available?\r\n\r\n- What is the life expectancy of the Digester?\r\n\r\n- Does your Company offer a formal sales presentation/pitch for the Digester? If so, can we schedule one?\r\n\r\n- Can you identify several locations that utilize your Digester?  (including other municipalities), and can you provide contact information for representatives at such sites for us to speak with?\r\n\r\n- Can we schedule a tour of a facility that utilizes your Digester?\r\n\r\n- Can you identify competitors of BioHiTech?\r\n\r\n- Could your Company offer suggestions for sizing the appropriate type of equipment, given our City’s particulars? What data would your Company require from us in order to provide sizing guidance for residential, businesses, and commercial needs (or some combination thereof)? Basically, we need assistance in estimating food scrap generation, other than an audit. \r\n\r\n- If an oversized Digester is purchased, the thinking being that the City would grow into it, is the effectiveness of the  compromised?\r\n\r\n- What are the housing requirements for your Digester? (indoor insulation/heat, electricity, water, etc.) Basically, what are the general start-up requirements. \r\n\r\n- What are the maintenance needs and concerns? \r\n\r\n- Have there been any repeated maintenance or other problems that your Company is aware of? \r\n\r\n- What is the environmental impact on the sewage system?\r\n\r\n- Are there concerns with respect to noise, odor, pests, or otherwise, that we should take into consideration?\r\n\r\n- Are there regulatory or permitting concerns that we should take into consideration?

But after all, this is our company's historical norm.\r\n\r\nWhat mostly worried me was the news after the call that we could expect an additional 7 million in revenue in 2019. Following our historical norm this may result in driving our earnings loss per qtr to be over $2. \r\n\r\nI have devised a ploy that may help our PR. We announce the formation of a seperate but secret division called project X. Over the next few months we truthfully announce that project X revenues AND positive earnings are increasing at an annual rate 100% per month. Eventually we'll have to announce that Project X has been terminated.

In reading how refuge is processed it appears plastics are a part of the oversized materials that bypass your entire process. \r\n\r\nIf so, this will draw to your attention to an as-yet little known American technology for the circular plastic economy that is drawing traction overseas and just beginning to gain voice in the US.  Dr. Swaminathan Ramesh, a retired Polymer Scientist of Livonia, Michigan, has patented a series of catalysts that transform the plastics made in greatest volume (PE, PP, PS) directly to fuel at a rate of about ten pounds of plastic per gallon of fuel for linear polymers.  Imagine, ten pounds of worthless, nuisance plastic can be converted to a gallon of diesel fuel valued at about $3.50. \r\n\r\nThe process unit containing the catalyst is compact and portable. Put the plastic waste in at one end of the device (the plastic is now gone!) and from the other end flows a fuel that retains and stores most of the energy formerly in the plastic for use at a time and place most beneficial to society; a circular solution!

I'm Rachel, a recent graduate from Towson University holding a bachelor of science in Environmental Science and Studies. Earth Week is 4/20-5/10, and to celebrate, I am planning a Town Hall influenced by the Sunrise Movement (link at bottom). I wish to gather people of different backgrounds and beliefs in order find a common ground based on the Green New Deal policies. The landmark report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released that at the current pace, the Earth stands only 12 years from a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Natural disasters deemed legendary will be outdone by far worse ones with time. Currently inhabited regions, retirement and tourist destinations will transition into regions that can no longer sustain life. The Green New Deal offers feasible solutions which attempt to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\nThe Green New Deal proposes to fight climate change and social injustices around the globe. It is backed by the term \"dominant alignment,\" which sets the political common sense on which both major parties operate, and can win sweeping victories over a decades-long time frame. A dominant alignment can only be achieved through strong public support, which then generates the necessary changes in policy to satisfy whatever it is that the public supports. My goal is to establish a political alignment based on shared values in order to reach a dominant alignment and lead us closer to the Green New Deal. I am formally requesting that you co-sponsor this event. I would also like to invite a representative from your business to attend so that he or she can educate local residents on how your technology has the potential to improve both the state of the Earth and of their local environments. I've done my research, and I know that your company is already doing some amazing work. We want your technologies in Maryland! We're just waiting on policymakers to give us the green light, and that's what the Sunrise Movement hopes to accelerate with meetings like these, formed by caring individuals like myself.\r\n\r\nThere will be small GND Town Halls like mine occurring during Earth Week all over the country, and most of us would agree that realistically, we must start small in order to produce big change. The location, date, and time of the event, as well as my contact information, are listed below. There is also a link to the event so you can view it on the map, and also RSVP!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRachel Epitropakis\r\n443-900-3236\r\n\r\n\r\nDate: Wednesday, May 8, 2019\r\nTime: 2-4pm\r\nLocation:\r\nBaltimore County Public Library\r\nPerry Hall Branch: 9685 Honeygo Boulevard Perry Hall, MD 21128\r\nParking lot - ample spaces; no permit required\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to the Event:\r\nhttps://actionnetwork.org/events/towson-green-new-deal-town-hall?clear_id=true\r\n\r\nLink for information about the Sunrise Movement:\r\nhttps://www.sunrisemovement.org/\r\n\r\nLink for the Green New Deal:\r\nhttps://www.gp.org/green_new_deal","contactType":"general","date":"2019-04-16T00:12:15.468Z"}

We are particularly interested in exploring whether the research priorities of soil scientists correspond with the priorities identified by those within the industries we are investigating, and how soil scientists could better meet these research needs in the future.\r\n\r\nWe have created a short questionnaire, which should take no longer than 5-10 minutes to complete. We were wondering if you would be happy to circulate this within your organisation, and pass it on to others working in waste management which might be interested. We hope that this research will help to identify knowledge gaps and avenues for future research within soil science. If you are involved in more than one industry, please answer the questions from each individual perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to questionnaire: https://cranfielduniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2iu911f34OdiAw5\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nDan Evans","contactType":"general","recaptchaToken":"03AOLTBLTpumQTw7r8hMNIP0_VeEH8HjM1c5qXhG9OgpF90xjnGVIlOWRwCTsKtqhAbc3YczSoiS-eeGpwJwMlVMC-nzGES_deyTYLswzG2xIjLemr7dl6j1lNlIOLN06eXJqeewQRpVb3_gXhwt6RirvVTc-WAp3PlzusXT35T6-pCn6iyzIEAtOGhf-DRqlAikRrZ86Mxq_t-auqKb2c6X4oVRNB_T4TAJqxKagI6za_OsWRW17KfDIRa69kapTnMNJyRdXaT77zRORU1WLwWCyC1RbHy1jCUs9Ym45Kae53sRPMsJVHTiKmtx74yeVil8FEODjmNgvuJCvq349HigLsqIPbzoGD9IXbJGQIWh1H-vKUbjSEgbAo7c_xLdoNQ2MccNutYt93XQJiRnIkgj-39rOaC9h4JPekEFavIX-nLYwzBqk0Rzg","recaptcha":{"success":true,"challenge_ts":"2020-02-04T08:19:50Z","hostname":"biohitech.com","score":0.9,"action":"contact_us"},"date":"2020-02-04T08:20:59.467Z"}
